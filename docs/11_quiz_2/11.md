Convert the regular main_activity layout to Data Binding, you need to wrap the root element in a \<layout> tag<br>

![img_2](img/img_2.PNG)<br>

![img_6](img/img_6.PNG)<br>

Do the same for the rest until they completely fill the whole screen.<br>

![img_7](img/img_7.PNG)<br>

Create the new MainActivityVM as a viewmodel with the following code<br>

![img_8](img/img_8.PNG)<br>

Then declare the new variable to handle the user input from main activity with the name something like bindTextInputParam and onClickSearch() method to handle the search button click and start another activity<br>

![img_9](img/img_9.PNG)<br>

Make a new activity with name ResultActivity that act as a logic data flow related to the setting content view from DataBindingUtil and assigned to ActivityResultBinding, intent thing and some another logical work.<br>

![img_10](img/img_10.PNG)<br>

Add a void method that receives string and context parameter to get and pass the search argument and start that activity<br>

![img_11](img/img_11.PNG)<br>

Add a new ResultActivityVM as another viewmodel and create a new bindTextParam variable then make a new method to set the result of layout text variable like the snippet below<br>

![img_12](img/img_12.PNG)<br>

The Data Binding Library used to bind the user input parameter into the activity_result layout in this case user search the name of the plant and send the data to anoher layout and show the result with the exact word as user did<br>

This Project uses the fragment to switch the background color from one fragment to another or vice-versa, the first fragment doesn't apply the background color and the second fragment use all the same element as the first but the background color<br>

Navigation used to move between one fragment or activity to another in this project. There are three different layouts to navigate from one to another<br> 

The viewmodel in this project designed to manage the data related to the User Interface therefore those datas could be used again if there is some change in user configuration<br>
