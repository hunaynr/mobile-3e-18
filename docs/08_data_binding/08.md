## Hasil Praktikum

### Try out the app without Data Binding

In this step, you download the code for the entire codelab and then run a simple example app.<br>

![img_01](img/img_01.PNG)<br>

Once the project is open, click Run 'app' or simply press Shift+F10 to run the app.<br>

Once the build is complete and the app is deployed to your device or emulator, the default activity opens and looks like this<br>

### Enable Data Binding and convert the layout

In order to convert the layout to Data Binding, you need to wrap the root element in a \<layout\> tag. You'll also have to move the namespace definitions (the attributes that start with xmlns:) to the new root element.<br>

![img_2](img/img_2.PNG)<br>

Now, let's bind some data!

### Create your first layout expression

Let's start with some static data binding for now.

- Create two String layout variables inside the <data> tag.<br>

![img_3](img/img_3.PNG)<br>

- Look for the TextView with the ID plain_name and add the android:text attribute with a layout expression<br>

![img_4](img/img_4.PNG)<br>

- Do the same thing with the plain_lastName text view<br>

![img_5](img/img_5.PNG)<br>

Now we need to modify the Activity so that it inflates a Data Binding layout correctly

### Change inflation and remove UI calls from activity

The layout is ready, but now it's necessary to make some changes in the activity. Open PlainOldActivity and inflate the plain_activity layout with this code<br>

![img_51](img/img_51.PNG)<br>

To see what a generated class looks like, open PlainActivitySolutionBinding, and take a look around.<br>

- Now you can set the variable values<br>

![img_6](img/img_6.PNG)<br>

You can start removing old code:<br>

- Remove the updateName() method, since the new Data Binding code is now finding the IDs and setting the text values.<br>

- Remove the updateName() call in onCreate()<br>

### Dealing with user events

Before modifying the event handling code, you can clean up the layout a bit.<br>

- First, replace the two variables for a single ViewModel. This is the way to go in the majority of cases since it keeps your presentation code and state in one place.<br>

![img_8](img/img_8.PNG)<br>

Instead of accessing the variables directly, call the viewmodel properties:<br>

- Change the layout expressions in both TextViews<br><br>

![img_9](img/img_9.PNG)<br><br>

![img_10](img/img_10.PNG)<br>

Also, update how clicks on the "Like" button are handled.<br>

![img_11](img/img_11.PNG)<br>

Now, remove things you don't need from the activity to use a viewmodel binding with this code<br>

![img_12](img/img_12.PNG)<br>

### Observing data

There are multiple ways to implement observability. You can use observable classes, observable fields, or, the preferred way, LiveData.<br

We're going to use ObservableFields as they are simpler with the new LiveData's<br> 

![img_14](img/img_14.PNG)<br>

Then set the LiveData's value with the value proprty and make one LiveData depend on another using Transformations also edit the fun onLike() with these snippet below

![img_15](img/img_15.PNG)<br>

Open PlainOldActivity and set the lifecycle owner in the binding object<br>

![img_17](img/img_17.PNG)<br>

Let's bind the TextView showing the number of likes to the observable integer. In plain_activity.xml<br>

![img_18](img/img_18.PNG)<br>

### Using Binding Adapters to create custom attributes

In the plain_activity layout, look for the progress bar and add the hideIfZero attribute<br>

![img_19](img/img_19.PNG)<br>

### Create a Binding Adapter with multiple parameters

Next, add the attributes to the XML<br>

![img_20](img/img_20.PNG)<br>

### Practice creating Binding Adapters

Practice makes perfect. Create:<br>

- a Binding Adapter that tints the color of the progress bar depending on the value of likes and adds the corresponding attribute
- a Binding Adapter that shows a different icon depending on the popularity:
- ic_person_black_96dp in black
- ic_whatshot_black_96dp in light pink
- ic_whatshot_black_96dp in bold pink<br>

Add the app:popularityIcon attribute to bind the popularity from viewmodel with this code below<br>

### Run the app
